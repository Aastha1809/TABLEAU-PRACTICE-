# TABLEAU-PRACTICE-
This project explores Spotify's music dataset using Python and data visualization techniques. 
In this project, we analyze two datasets to uncover trends in the music industry using data visualization. The first dataset focuses on song popularity, energy levels, and other track attributes, helping us understand how musical characteristics impact a songâ€™s success. The second dataset provides insights into artists, albums, and their performance across various music streaming platforms, allowing us to compare artist popularity, album success, and cross-platform trends.
